#### Title: 
~ Automation of instant-tea powder making process using PLC and SCADA

#### Objective:
~To automatically monitor and control two parameters, i) Temperature and ii) Level

* This project is based on industrial process automation.

* Motivation is to implement the theoretical concepts to practical i.e. to exhibit process automation using two very important components     of industrial automation Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA).

* Increased productivity, reduced human error, high quality and reliability are among many advantages of process automation, as a whole 
  automation plays a crucial role in almost every industry

* I considered an instant-tea powder manufacturing process, where I developed a prototype of a part of the full process.

* Objective is to show monitoring and automatic control of two important process parameters i.e. Temperature and Level.

* PLC has been used as interface between field I/O devices and SCADA system.

* SCADA system is used to monitor the I/O status.

* The Components used for the project and SCADA screen result during process has been shown by videos which are self-explanatory.

* Another video shows the experiment running condition
